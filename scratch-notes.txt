*** REACT ***

What is React?:
- a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”


Components:
- React.Component
- components tell React what we want to see on the screen
- when data changes, React will update and re-render our components

    // ShoppingList is a "React component class" or "React component type"
    class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className="shopping-list">
            <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Instagram</li>
              <li>WhatsApp</li>
              <li>Oculus</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    // Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />


Props:
- components take in parameters, called props (short for “properties”)


Render:
- components return a hierarchy of views to display via the render method
- render returns a "React element"


JSX:
- most developers use JSX
- syntax to simplify writing react elements

    // Equivalent to the above ShoppingList syntax
    return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
      React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
      React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
    );

- JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript
- each React element is a JavaScript object stored and passed in variables
- refer to the whole shopping list by writing <ShoppingList />
